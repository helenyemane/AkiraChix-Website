<p style="color: black;"> I was both scared and excited when I first came to AkiraChix. It's not easy to leave everything behind and adapt to a new enviroment, but at the same time it's also a great opportunity to be one step closer to my dreams. </p>
<p style="color: black;"> I was learning how the institution works in the first week but as days pass by I get used to the enviroment. I met great people who I can get along with even outside this enviroment. I love the way we learn, it's so engaging. In the mean time there are things that I'm still struggling with but it will be worth it at the end of the day.</p>
    
<h2 style="color: lightblue;">Things that I love</h2>
<ol>
    <li>The effortfull and engaging way of learning</li>
    <li>Meeting all these amzing girls from different countries</li>
    <li>The neatness of the campus</li>
    <li>The freedom I have in class</li>
    <li>The weather</li>
    
    

</ol>

    <h2 style="color: lightblue;">Challenges I faced</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The foods that I'm not familiar with</li>
        <li>Not going back to the dorm after I left</li>
        <li>Not getting enough rest</li>
        


    </ul>

    
<p style="color: black;">Over all, I'm just enjoying the process and embaracing every things that comes with it. I look forward to see a better version of my self both acadamically and personally.</p>
